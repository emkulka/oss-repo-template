Understanding the Open Source Definition

It goes without saying that one of the main components of the Open Source Definition is that the source code must be included and must allow distribution; without this, people wouldn't be able to utilize the code (use, study, change, etc.). It also makes sense that a large poriton of this criteria is based on licensing, since it is important to have the proper licenses in place to support the product and its creator(s) while also allowing use of the product by others.

`How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way`

1. Don't make the person you're helping feel stupid for asking (don't be condescending). I've had many people make me feel inferior when I asked for help in the past ("this is pretty obvious...", "you _didn't_ know this? seriously?", etc.) and these responses made me very nervous/apprehensive to ask more questions in the future.

2. Please feel free to direct people to other resources, specifically ones you have used and/or know are credible. It's okay to support your answers with other pre-existing information.
