Understanding the Open Source Definition

It goes without saying that one of the main components of the Open Source Definition is that the source code must be included and must allow distribution; without this, people wouldn't be able to utilize the code (use, study, change, etc.). It also makes sense that a large poriton of this criteria is based on licensing, since it is important to have the proper licenses in place to support the product and its creator(s) while also allowing use of the product by others.

`How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way`

1. Don't make the person you're helping feel stupid for asking (don't be condescending). I've had many people make me feel inferior when I asked for help in the past ("this is pretty obvious...", "you _didn't_ know this? seriously?", etc.) and these responses made me very nervous/apprehensive to ask more questions in the future.

2. Please feel free to direct people to other resources, specifically ones you have used and/or know are credible. It's okay to support your answers with other pre-existing information.

Chapter 3 of Free Culture

This chapter from Free Culture was honestly a bit scary to read. It's nervewracking to think that tinkering with search engines or other tools could lead to a major lawsuit that could significantly impact your life. I find it difficult to understand what exactly Jesse did wrong, since he did not encourage people to put music in their public folders in any way. I'm also confused on how the RIAA justified their claims against Jesse as he made no money of the the search engine, and did not actually build this system. One takeaway I have from this reading is that it is very important to read through and understand all of the copyright and licensing policies of a project before working on it. While this takeaway sounds simple on paper, it likely is not as simple in practice. Oftentimes these policies are not easily accessible, or if they are they will be very long and difficult to read through. It almost seems as if groups like the RIAA want to take advantage of people like Jesse in order to make more money.

An open source project that I found interesting is [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/). I found this project on [Google Open Source](https://opensource.google/projects/explore/featured) after looking through some of the featured projects. Gerrit is a web-based code review system for projects using Git. One of the main features listed on the webiste is the ability to discuss code within the files themselves. Comments and threads can be added by multiple users, sections can be marked as "unreviewed" or reviewed", and more. After reading through the project's website, I also inspected the source code a bit. The majority of this project is written in Java (ust under 75%). Finally, I read through some of the documentation that further explains how Gerrit works. I am interested in this project because I understand the importance of code reviews in building successful code, and having this feature integrated directly into Git would likely make this process more accessible and efficient.
