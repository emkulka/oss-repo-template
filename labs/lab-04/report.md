# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

## 1.

(see bottom of lab report and [this file](https://github.com/emkulka/oss-repo-template/blob/master/labs/lab-04/LICENSE.md) for license information)

## 2. 

From the reading, the four criteria for Free Software are
 - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
 - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## 3. 

It is important to choose a license so that you (creator, collaborator) can adequately protect your work. Not only does a licensce protect the work you create, but it also protects those who use your software. Additionally, if a license is not chosen, there can be issues with ownership and/or copyright. If a license is not there to spell out the guidelines of use for the project then nobody can claim ownership or continue to use it. 

## 4. 

It can be very risky to use a project without a license for many reasons, and therefore you should avoid using such a project. A project that is not explicitly licensed has no copyright or distribution rules attached to it, and if you were to use it your own work you could lose the ability to use the project at any time or even be pursued for potential copyright infringement or other infractions.

I do agree with the claim that the Web development team did better than the Gopher team in regards to implementing an open systems model. The Gopher team did not release their software early in the development process and thus lost out on establishing a strong developer base early on. Additionally, the Gopher team required payment for licensing fees for hosts with a .com domain, which caused many people to re-evaluate their use and support of Gopher.

## 6. 

Microsoft .NET Core uses an MIT license. This license was likely chosen because it has very limited restrictions on re-use of the project and is therefore highly compatible with other licenses and projects. The .NET framework is a very widely-used platform; a less-restrive license makes sense in this context because it will almost always be compatible with the licenses of the projects that utilize it. Additionally, .NET encourages and supports contributions to the project, and the MIT license is very permissive of contributions as well as re-use.
