## Checkpoint 2

Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?

Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?

Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the _Nightly_, _Nightly Expected_ or one of the _Masters_ sections. How _clean_ is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?
