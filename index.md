## Bio
Hello! My name is Elise Kulka and I'm a senior computer science major. Software development is one of my main interests, and I am looking forward to learning more about open source software this semester. I have experience in C, C++, C#, Python and Java.
Outside of coding and computing, I am part of the Rensselyrics a cappella group on campus.
